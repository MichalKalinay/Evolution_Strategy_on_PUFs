Differences between mockup and real problem (assumption here is an arbiter PUFs as I understood it during the first meeting):

vars:
	Genome - List[Tuple[float]] a genome will represent the PUF. Each tuple will be a gate and the floats represent the time it takes for electricity to go though either cable
	Population - Equivalent to mockup

	Item - Gate / Switch. Is a sequence of 1 and 0 (maybe bool?) representing the input for the arbiter PUF to calculate
	Items - Challenges. List of challenges for the PUF to calculate the results

functions:
	runEvolution - should be exactly the same
	generateGenome - Same thing. Unless there are other option than random generation
	generatePopulation - Equivalent to mockup
	fitness - Genomes still have to be same size. Loop: Calculate the results of the challenges (result maybe how many are correct?)
	selectPair - Equivalent to mockup (part of standard ES)
	singlePointCrossover - Has to be changed. Maybe take the averages of the floats in the genomes
	mutation - Slightly change random value(s) in the genome



This is a very rough estimate of the changes since I still don't know which PUFs will be taken and how that kind will work in detail.
It should still translate to other PUFs since this is based on an arbiter PUF.
