If you wish to run this, I strongly recommend using an IDE.
You will need to:

</p>
<p>

> **pip install numpy pypuf matplotlib**

> **Mark the folders Puf Problem/Classes and Puf Problem/Functions as sources for imports.**

</p>

<p>

Simply run *Puf Problem/main.py* to run the main program.
This will also generate a Log file in the same directory.

To change parameters you need to modify the *main.py* and either change the parameters in the definition of the main function or in the call at the bottom of the file.
